<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is HoseCraft?</h3>

<p>HoseCraft is a Minecraft Classic server software (Just when you thought Classic was dead eh?) based off the original Mojang Classic server. Decompiled from the latest classic server released by Notch we've built ontop of Notch's original code to add in API's for plugins. HoseCraft is the ideal classic server if you wish to get as close as you can to the original Minecraft Classic server experience but with the added plugin API.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API? Does this mean plugins?</h3>

<p>Yup! It certainly does. Our API is heavily based upon that of Bukkit's, if you know how to write a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin you can easily find your way around creating a HoseCraft plugin. We've got JavaDocs for anyone interested and an example plugin too. Keep an eye on our readme for what is and isn't implemented. So far plugins have a lot of access to modify the player's ability to build, destroy and move as well as add in custom commands.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Started by one guy, contributed to by many</h3>

<p>HoseCraft is entirely open source and requires no work arounds to get running in Intellij or on your server. Due to the open nature of HoseCraft you can produce your own fixes and additions. Like all GitHub projects your push must be approved first. All contributions must not affect a standard install of HoseCraft and must be as close to Vanilla Classic as it can be. This means custom level generators will be rejected and anything else that modifies the experience. Commands may be accepted dependant on what they change.</p>
